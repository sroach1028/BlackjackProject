### Week 4 Project

  BlackJack
  created by Shaun Roach
  at Skill Distillery, Denver, CO  

##  About the Project

This program is a simple version of BlackJack, one player (the user) against computer, with one deck of cards.


##  Technologies Used

This program is written in Java code using Eclipse IDE. I incorporated concepts of abstractionism, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.


##  Lessons Learned

I learned in this project that when checking against many conditions, object oriented principals are especially helpful for keeping the code in useful order. Drawing and writing the envisioned flow of operations in this program beforehand was important for keeping the actual code organized and prevented it from twisting and turning in too many directions.
